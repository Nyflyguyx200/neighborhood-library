Interesting Code: 

for (Book book : inventory) {
This line of code utilizes an enhanced for loop to iterate through the inventory array of Book objects.
It's interesting because it showcases a concise and readable way to iterate through arrays or collections in Java, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
It demonstrates the power of Java's language features in simplifying common programming tasks.
